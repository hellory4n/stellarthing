[It's in the docs folder](./docs/starry.md)

## Building

You need Go 1.23.6 or higher

[See this for dependencies](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements)

On Linux you can also cross-compile with `release.sh`

I tried cross-compiling to macOS too but it just didn't work several times
