# Starry C

Got a random segfault in C#, C is great because all of your segfaults are your own skill issue

## Building

install raylib (`raylib-devel` on fedora, not sure if other distros have it)

run `make && ./stellarthing`

you can also compile from linux to windows if you're insane:

1. step 1: install wine
2. step 2: [install raylib on wine](https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib/purchase)
3. step 3: run raylib installation/w64devkit.exe
4. step 4: compile the project like you would on linux
